<h1> Face Creation</h1>


This app can create you face just like a sketch artist.

Here we took random face images from <b>Facebook</b> and saved each of their features in different variables. Then users can choose the features and make a face of their own choice.
It works just as the doctors create face during <b>Plastic Surgery</b>.
